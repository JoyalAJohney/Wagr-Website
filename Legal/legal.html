        be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of
        law rules. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally
        settled by arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, using the English language in accordance with the

        <br />
        General<br />
        This Agreement is the entire agreement between User and Whistle with respect to the Product, and supersedes all
        prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between User and
        Whistle with respect to the Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge the existence and
        validity of the Terms of Use. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Terms of Use, this
        Agreement shall control with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement only. If any provision of this
        Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
        extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The
        failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver
        of any further rights hereunder. This Agreement is personal to User, and is not assignable or transferable by
        User except with Whistle&apos;s prior written consent. Whistle may assign, transfer or delegate any of its
        rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment
        relationship is created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind
        the other in any respect. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been
        duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
        requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or two days after
        it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.<br />
