        purchasing your Whistle GPS or Whistle Activity Monitor you are not completely satisfied, you may return it to
        us for a refund. This guarantee applies only to orders made through Whistle’s webstore at whistle.com and only

        subscription period which were pre-paid for under a 1-year or 2-year plan. To request a refund for your device,

        completely satisfied, you may return it to us for a refund. Please note the 90-day guarantee applies only to
        the Whistle 3. It does not apply to any other Whistle products. In addition, this guarantee applies only to
        orders made through Whistle’s webstore at whistle.com and only to fees paid for your Whistle 3. The guarantee
        does not apply to funds paid for any used subscription to the Whistle tracking services, however, a pro-rated

        a 1-year or 2-year plan. To request a refund for your Whistle 3, simply contact Whistle Support within 90 days

        <br />
        Export<br />
        Notwithstanding anything stated herein or otherwise, User may not provide to any person or export or re-export
        or allow the export or re-export of the Product, Services or any Software or anything related thereto or any
        direct product thereof (collectively “Controlled Subject Matter”), in violation of any restrictions, laws or
        regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of
        Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority. Without limiting the
        foregoing, User acknowledges and agrees that the Controlled Subject Matter will not be used or transferred or
        otherwise exported or re-exported to countries as to which the United States maintains an embargo
        (collectively, “Embargoed Countries”), or to or by a national or resident thereof, or any person or entity on
        the U.S. Department of Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s
        Table of Denial Orders (collectively, “Designated Nationals”). The lists of Embargoed Countries and Designated
        Nationals are subject to change without notice. Use of the Product constitutes a representation and warranty
        that the User is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of an Embargoed Country or
        Designated National. The Controlled Subject Matter may use or include encryption technology that is subject to
        licensing requirements under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.<br />
        <br />
        Dispute Resolution<br />
        User agrees that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Product must commence within one (1) year
        after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. The Terms of Use shall
        be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of
        law rules. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally
        settled by arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, using the English language in accordance with the
        Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&quot;JAMS&quot;) then
        in effect, and otherwise in accordance with dispute resolution terms and conditions located at
        www.whistle.com/terms-of-use.<br />
        <br />
        General<br />
        This Agreement is the entire agreement between User and Whistle with respect to the Product, and supersedes all
        prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between User and
        Whistle with respect to the Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge the existence and
        validity of the Terms of Use. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Terms of Use, this
        Agreement shall control with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement only. If any provision of this
        Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
        extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The
        failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver
        of any further rights hereunder. This Agreement is personal to User, and is not assignable or transferable by
        User except with Whistle&apos;s prior written consent. Whistle may assign, transfer or delegate any of its
        rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment
        relationship is created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind
        the other in any respect. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been
        duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
        requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or two days after
        it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.<br />
